# 📊 ULTRA FULL SYSTEM AUDIT REPORT — KOTЭ SYSTEM

**Date:** 18 June 2026  
**System:** Нестандартный Отдых (Non-Standart Travel)  
**Repository:** ibetekhtin/kote-system  
**VPS:** Hetzner 77.42.93.187  
**Supabase:** cmmdrhususjuadqzyssc (us-east-1)  
**n8n Cloud:** ibetekhtin.app.n8n.cloud  

---

## 1. Executive Summary

A comprehensive audit of the entire KOTЭ system was performed across 14 stages, analyzing ~100+ files including source code, infrastructure configurations, database schemas, deployment scripts, and business logic.

**Overall Health: FAIR** — Core architecture (single DB, multi-market, n8n-driven AI bot) is sound, but significant security gaps and infrastructure hardening are needed.

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Issues Found | 47 |
| Critical (P0) | 4 |

## 2. Critical Issues (P0)

### P0-1: 💥 Secrets Exposed in Documentation
**File:** `МАСТЕР_ФАЙЛ_ПРОЕКТА.md`  
**Detail:** Plaintext exposure of `KOTE_SECRET`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `TELEGRAM_ADMIN_CHAT_ID` in the master project file.  
**Risk:** Anon key allows read access to Supabase. KOTE_SECRET controls RPC access.  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED — Secrets redacted to `<set in .env>` placeholders.

### P0-2: 🔓 No SSL/HTTPS on Production
**File:** `deploy/nginx.conf`  
**Detail:** Nginx configured for plain HTTP only. All traffic unencrypted.  
**Risk:** Man-in-the-middle attacks, credential interception, SEO penalty.  
**Status:** ⚠️ PATCHED — nginx.conf updated with SSL-ready config + security headers. Needs `certbot --nginx` to activate.

### P0-3: 💾 No Automated Backup Strategy
**File:** `deploy/backup-supabase.sh`  
**Detail:** Only DB backup existed. No config backup, no n8n data backup, no off-site storage, no recovery procedure.  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED — Backup script enhanced with config backup, S3 upload support, retention policies, logging.

### P0-4: 🚫 Missing RLS Policies on Production Tables
**File:** `supabase/schema.sql`  
**Detail:** `bookings`, `payments`, `reviews` tables had no RLS policies. Any anon key holder could read/write bookings.  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED — Migration `005_performance_and_security.sql` adds RLS policies for all tables.

---

## 3. High Priority Issues (P1)

### P1-1: 📄 Duplicate Tour Page (`moto_tour.html` / `mototour.html`)
**File:** `nestandart-phuket/tours/moto_tour.html`  
**Impact:** SEO duplicate content penalty, confusing UX  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED — Removed `moto_tour.html` (old version), retained `mototour.html` (new version with schema.org)

### P1-2: 🐳 No Resource Limits on Docker Containers
**File:** `docker-compose.yml`  
**Impact:** Any container OOM can crash the entire VPS  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED — Added memory limits (512M backend, 256M bot, 512M n8n) + logging limits

### P1-3: 🚀 Zero-Downtime Deployment Gap
**File:** `deploy/deploy.sh`  
**Impact:** Service interruption on every deploy, no rollback plan  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED — Added pre-flight checks, health verification, backup before deploy, rollback script

### P1-4: 🛡️ Missing Security Headers in Nginx
**File:** `deploy/nginx.conf`  
**Impact:** Vulnerable to clickjacking, XSS, MIME sniffing  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED — Added headers: X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, XSS-Protection, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy, HSTS (commented)

### P1-5: 🚦 No API Rate Limiting
**File:** `deploy/nginx.conf`  
**Impact:** Vulnerable to abuse, brute force, DoS  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED — Added rate limiting zones (30r/s API, 10r/s webhooks)

### P1-6: ❤️ Missing HEALTHCHECK in Dockerfiles
**Files:** `app/backend/Dockerfile`, `platform/bot/Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`  
**Impact:** Docker/K8s can't detect service health  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED — Added HEALTHCHECK directives to all Dockerfiles + n8n service in compose

### P1-7: 📊 Sitemap Missing 70% of Pages
**File:** `nestandart-phuket/sitemap.xml`  
**Impact:** Poor SEO — only 14 URLs indexed, 26 tour pages missing  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED — Updated to include all 26 tours + 10 blog posts

## 6. Security Findings

### Critical Security Gaps

1. **Secrets in git history** — Even though `МАСТЕР_ФАЙЛ_ПРОЕКТА.md` is now clean, the secrets exist in git history. **Action:** Rotate KOTE_SECRET, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY, TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN, GEMINI_API_KEY immediately.

2. **No SSL** — Traffic between users and the VPS is unencrypted. **Action:** Run `sudo certbot --nginx -d nestandart-phuket.ru`

3. **Supabase anon key exposed in docs** — Now fixed, but was in git history. The anon key can read `tours`, `markets` (public data) but RPC functions with SECURITY DEFINER need careful audit.

### Security Best Practices Implemented

- ✅ Nginx security headers added
- ✅ Rate limiting configured
- ✅ Docker containers use `expose` only (no public ports)
- ✅ RLS policies on all tables
- ✅ `.gitignore` expanded for secrets
- ✅ `client_max_body_size` limited to 10M
- ✅ Hidden file access blocked in nginx
- ✅ Conversations rate limit function added

---

## 7. Infrastructure Findings

### VPS (Hetzner 77.42.93.187)

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Nginx | ⚠️ Fixed | SSL config ready but not activated |
| Docker Backend | ✅ Healthy | Port 8000 |
| Docker n8n | ⚠️ Missing health check | ✅ Fixed |
| Docker Bot | ⛔ Disabled | In n8n Cloud |
| pm2 API | ✅ /api/leads on 3055 | Legacy service |

### Docker Optimization

- ✅ Memory limits configured
- ✅ Logging limits (max-size 10m, max-file 3)
- ✅ HEALTHCHECK on all services
- ✅ `.dockerignore` prevents bloated builds
- ❌ Image version pinning not done (uses `:latest` for n8n)

---

## 8. Supabase Findings

### Schema Analysis

| Table | RLS | Indexes | Status |
|-------|-----|---------|--------|
| `markets` | ✅ | ✅ | Good |
| `tours` | ✅ | ⚠️ Added | ✅ Fixed |
| `clients` | ✅ | ⚠️ Missing | ✅ Fixed |
| `bookings` | ❌ | ⚠️ Missing | ✅ Fixed |
| `conversations` | ⚠️ Weak | ⚠️ Missing | ✅ Fixed |
| `payments` | ❌ | ⚠️ Missing | ✅ Fixed |
| `reviews` | ❌ | ⚠️ Missing | ✅ Fixed |
| `knowledge` | ✅ | ⚠️ Added | ✅ Fixed |
| `client_memory` | ✅ (RPC only) | ⚠️ Added | ✅ Fixed |
| `action_history` | ✅ | ⚠️ Added | ✅ Fixed |

### Performance SQL Generated

All optimizations in `supabase/migrations/005_performance_and_security.sql`:
- 22 new indexes
- 6 RLS policies
- 1 rate limiting function
- 3 composite indexes for frequent queries
- Table analysis for query planner

---

## 9. N8N Findings

### Workflow Status

| Workflow | Status | Error Handling | Issues |
|----------|--------|---------------|--------|
| КотЭ — AI Agent | ✅ Active | ⚠️ Missing ErrorTrigger | No retry logic |
| New Leads Notification | ✅ Active | ⚠️ Missing ErrorTrigger | No retry logic |
| Tour Reminder | ✅ Active | ⚠️ Missing ErrorTrigger | No retry logic |
| Review Request | ✅ Active | ⚠️ Missing ErrorTrigger | No retry logic |
| Booking Confirm (backup) | ⚠️ Untracked | ⚠️ Missing | Stale export |
| Booking Flow (backup) | ⚠️ Untracked | ⚠️ Missing | Stale export |
| Lead Intake (backup) | ⚠️ Untracked | ⚠️ Missing | Stale export |
| SOS (backup) | ⚠️ Untracked | ⚠️ Missing | Stale export |

### Credential Audit
- Telegram tokens: Stored in n8n credentials (secure)
- Supabase credentials: Not actively used in cloud workflows
- GEMINI_API_KEY: In n8n env vars (secure)
- KOTE_SECRET: Used in `get_kote_context` RPC calls (removed from docs)

### Recommendations
- Add ErrorTrigger nodes to all active workflows
- Add retry logic (2-3 attempts with exponential backoff)
- Export current cloud workflows and overwrite local backups
- Verify Supabase credential in n8n still works

---

## 10. Telegram Bot Findings

The Python bot (`platform/bot/`) is **disabled** (`profiles: bot`) — production uses n8n Cloud.

### Architecture
- Disabled Python bot: aiogram 3.x + Gemini → just runs in cloud
- Active n8n Cloud bot: Telegram webhook → n8n → Gemini → Supabase

### Issues in Disabled Python Bot
- ✅ No security issues found (well-structured)
- ⚠️ Duplicate of n8n cloud workflow logic
- ⚠️ `admin_notify.py` uses hardcoded `TELEGRAM_ADMIN_CHAT_ID` import
- ✅ Proper use of env vars for all secrets

---

## 11. Performance Findings

### Backend Performance
- ✅ Minimal FastAPI with direct Supabase RPC calls
- ⚠️ No caching layer (Redis/memcached) — all queries hit Supabase
- ⚠️ No query pagination on tours endpoint (all tours returned at once)
- ✅ CORS limited to known origins

### Database Performance
- ✅ New indexes will significantly speed up frequent queries
- ⚠️ No connection pooling configured
- ⚠️ No read replica for Supabase

### Frontend Performance
- ⚠️ Static HTML pages — no lazy loading
- ⚠️ Images not optimized (17 of 33 tours missing photos)
- ⚠️ No CDN configured

### Recommendations
- Add Redis caching for tour catalog and knowledge base
- Implement query pagination (limit/offset)
- Use Supabase connection pooling
- Add CDN (Cloudflare) for static assets
- Optimize images with WebP format

---

## 12. Backup Findings

### Current State
| Backup Type | Before Audit | After Audit |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| Database | ✅ pg_dump (basic) | ✅ pg_dump (custom format + gzip) |
| Nginx config | ❌ Missing | ✅ Included in config backup |
| Docker compose | ❌ Missing | ✅ Included |
| .env files | ❌ Missing | ✅ Included |
| n8n data | ❌ Missing | ✅ Included |
| Off-site storage | ❌ Missing | ✅ S3 upload ready |
| Retention policy | ❌ Missing | ✅ 30 days daily + 12 weeks weekly |
| Recovery procedure | ❌ Missing | ✅ Rollback script created |

### Recommended Crontab
```bash
# Daily backup at 3 AM
0 3 * * * /opt/kote/deploy/backup-supabase.sh

# Monitoring every 5 minutes
*/5 * * * * /opt/kote/deploy/monitoring.sh
```

---

## 13. Monitoring Findings

### Implemented
- ✅ Monitoring script (`deploy/monitoring.sh`) — checks system, Docker, API, backups, SSL
- ✅ Telegram alerts for critical issues
- ✅ Slack webhook support
- ✅ De-duplication of alerts (1-hour cooldown)

### Still Missing
- ❌ No uptime monitoring service (e.g., UptimeRobot, Better Uptime)
- ❌ No application performance monitoring (e.g., Sentry for Python errors)
- ❌ No Supabase query performance monitoring
- ❌ No n8n workflow execution monitoring (built-in but not reviewed)
- ❌ No grafana/prometheus stack

---

## 14. Cost Optimization Opportunities

| Area | Current | Recommendation | Estimated Savings |
|------|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| n8n Cloud | Paid cloud plan | Evaluate if local n8n (already deployed) can replace | $20-50/mo |
| VPS | Hetzner CAX31? | Right-size based on actual usage | $5-15/mo |
| Supabase | Free tier | Current usage likely within limits | $0 |
| CDN | None | Cloudflare free tier | Free |
| Images | Unoptimized | Convert to WebP, lazy load | Bandwidth savings |

### Recommendations
1. Consider migrating n8n workflows from Cloud to local Docker n8n (already deployed!)
2. Add Cloudflare for CDN + DDoS protection (free tier available)
3. Audit Supabase usage for potential Pro tier upgrade needs

---

## 15. Revenue Growth Opportunities

As CTO, the highest ROI improvements to scale revenue:

### Immediate (1-2 weeks)
1. **Connect YooKassa** — Enable online payments. Current `payments` table has 0 rows. This alone could convert 30-50% more bookings.
2. **Add "Write to KotЭ" button** on website — All CTA buttons lead to Telegram @manager. Redirect to @bot for 24/7 AI sales.
3. **Fix 17 missing tour photos** — Tours without images have significantly lower conversion.

### Short-term (2-4 weeks)
4. **Enable Pattaya market** — 15 tours ready, just flip the flag.
5. **Collect reviews** — Review workflow exists but never triggered (no completed tours). Seed with initial reviews.
6. **Implement analytics** — Track: traffic source → bot conversation → booking → payment → review. Identify funnel leaks.

### Medium-term (1-3 months)
7. **Referral program** — Add referral tracking. Travel is inherently social.
8. **Abandoned cart recovery** — n8n workflow for clients stuck in "thinking" stage for >24h.
9. **Bali/Dubai expansion** — Data in DB, just need content + tours.
